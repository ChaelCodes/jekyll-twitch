It's been a while since the last release. Jekyll-Twitch is feature complete in my eyes, unless folks start asking for the interactive embeds or custom sizes in the embed. This release just includes security fixes from the last year.

# Changes
- [#16](https://github.com/ChaelCodes/jekyll-twitch/pull/16) Bump rexml from 3.2.4 to 3.2.5
- [#17](https://github.com/ChaelCodes/jekyll-twitch/pull/17) Bump addressable from 2.7.0 to 2.8.1
